#summary How come I get a certificate error?
#labels FAQ

In Mono, you get this error:

{{{
ERROR: System.IO.IOException: The authentication or decryption has failed. ---> Mono.Security.Protocol.Tls.TlsException: Invalid certificate received form server.
}}}

This means that your server has an SSL/TLS certificate that is not signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) that your system trusts.  You can either fix the certificate problem (preferred), or set:

{{{
bedrock.net.AsyncSocket.UntrustedRootOK = true;
}}}

UntrustedRootOK is now obsolete in the head of subversion.  The default behavior is to pop up an ugly dialog box to allow the certificate.  If you want to build a better dialog box, catch OnIvalidCertificate.
